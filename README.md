PassGen is a simple C# password generator that automatically generates a secure password based on user parameters.
This is a work in progress. As of now it is CLI only and obviously not in a finished form.
Feel free to use the code if you'd like, though!
I went with .txt files of words so they can be customized. Just open up the file and add your own words and save it and you're good to go!
If you notice, the word lists are sorted by letter count. 
If you do not obey the letter count in the filename, the program may output incorrect results.
